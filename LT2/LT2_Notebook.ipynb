    "The data is structured such that each row represents a region (unless they're the ones for the whole Philippines) and a year. The regions under the Philippines (under column Geolocation) all start with two periods. What is important to consider is that there is a period, which takes on values such as \"Annual\" or a specified quarter, under each year. In terms of the columns, the dataframe has 24 columns. Some columns have no values and instead contain two periods. Based on my understanding of the column names and the terms defined above, this set of data describes a particular region in terms of the construction done there at a particular time through details such as its worth (value), purpose (residential or not), and area size. As such, analysis can be easily done because you will be able to compare a certain region's standing in contrast to another region's. Moreover, one can look at things such as how much is residential compared to non-residential.\n",

    "To clean and transform the data, one may opt to change the \"..\" values in the columns where a number should be and turn them into a 0, which can be processed once we plot or graph it. The data is mostly numeric so we're expecting to use these in the data presentation later on. The periods before the region names may be discarded as well. Simply put, we're making the data more presentable and applicable to the graphing features of Python.\n"
